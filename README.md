- Pre Research Report - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dYaOAc7w-16r9ug63ZHu-SeWzq5X_7CE/view?usp=sharing

- Leveraging blockchain to enhance track and traceability of pharmaceuticals.
- Eliminating counterfeit drugs, enhancing transparency, ensuring authenticity and integrity.
- Proof-of-concept (POC) demonstrating capabilities and answering critical questions.

Our primary focus during our Final Year Project (FYP) was on acquiring knowledge. We extensively researched through various resources such as research papers, blogs, articles, and consulted seniors and industry professionals. Furthermore, we aimed to acquire skills through the implementation of in-demand technologies, including:

- **Smart Contract:** Access Control and ERC-721 with custom Solidity and OpenZepplin for standardized code.
- **Production Test Nets:** Goerli and Sepolia for Ethereum test net deployment.
- **Libraries:** wagmi (web3 hooks React) | react-qr-code | MUI 5+ | next-pwa
- **Wallet:** Metamask for transactions, authentication, and authorization.
- **Frontend & Backend:** NextJS 13+ with TypeScript 4+
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas for indexing results
- **Local Test Net:** Hardhat
- **Hosting:** Vercel
